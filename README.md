#Python Modules

Python modules are .py files that consist of Python code. Any Python file can be referenced as a module.

Some modules are available through the _Python Standard Library_ and are therefore installed with your Python installation. Others can be installed with Pythonâ€™s package manager pip. Additionally, **you can create your own Python modules since modules are comprised of Python .py files.**
